# Arcade -- Epitech project

The Arcade consists of learning how dynamic libraries work.

The project has an Arcade core with dynamic games and graphical libraries.
Common interfaces are built between them to make it work.

We have 3 games : Pacman, Snake and SolarFox.

And 4 graphical displays using : SFML, SDL2, Allegro and LibCaca (text only).
